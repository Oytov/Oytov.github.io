        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a computer science student with a big fascination for electronics and electricity in general. I know python to an intermediate - advanced level,
            C to a beginner - intermediate level, and bare minimum HTML - CSS knowledge. I am learning x86 assembly, C++ and HTML, CSS, JS. I love optimizing code and
            executables for size, this interest was built by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kkrieger" style="color:azure">.kkrieger</a>. Talking about
            real life languages, I know english and hindi <i>(debateable)</i>. I am learning russian so I can curse people here without fear of anyone understanding.
